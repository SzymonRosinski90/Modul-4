    <h1>Closer</h1>
    <h2><i>The Chainsmokers</i></h2>
    <p>Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you</p>
    <p>I drink too much and that's an issue but I'm okay</p>
    <p>Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them</p>
    <p>But I hope I never see them again</p>
    <p>I know it breaks your heart</p>
    <p>Moved to the city in a broke down car</p>
    <p>And four years, no calls</p>
    <p>Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar</p>
    <p>And I I I can't stop</p>
    <p>No, I I I can't stop</p>
    <br>
    <p>So baby, pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover</p>
    <p>That I know you can't afford</p>
    <p>Bite that tattoo on your shoulder</p>
    <p>Pull the sheets right off the corner</p>
    <p>Of the mattress that you stole</p>
    <p>From your roommate back in Boulder</p>
    <p>We ain't ever getting older</p>
    <p>We ain't ever getting older</p>
    <p>We ain't ever getting older</p>
    <br>
    <p>You look as good as the day I met you</p>
    <p>I forget just why I left you, I was insane</p>
    <p>Stay and play that blink-182 song</p>
    <p>That we beat to death in Tucson, okay</p>
    <p>I know it breaks your heart</p>
